COMS 4995-001 (Science of Blockchains): Final Project: Proposal
Instructions and Some Sample Topics
Project proposal instructions
By 11:59pm on Friday, March 14th, each team should submit a project proposal of length 1–2 pages. (The
more specific and concrete the proposal, the better the feedback from the course staff will be.) Submissions
will be made via Gradescope.
Potential project topics
Below is a suggested list of potential project topics along with links and citations to relevant sources which
serve as good starting points for learning more about the topic. In particular, the links and citations provided
are not an exhaustive list for the purposes of project requirements, and are listed to serve as gateways for a
deeper dive into the topic at hand.
Students are also encouraged to dream up their own project topics (not on the following list), in which
case they should run their ideas by the course staff (Naveen/Yuval/Tim) for feedback before submitting a
proposal.

and ecosystem), or Solana (Jito). Jito, Flashbots, PBS original blog post.
15. Infrastructure project: Contribute to the Solana/Base/Eth ecosystem by building some non trivial
tool.
16. Deep dive into L2 interoperability. Espresso.
17. Explore recent alternatives to Tendermint, such as Streamlet/Simplex [CS20, CP23].
18. Account abstraction deep dive (e.g., EIP-3074 vs. EIP-4337 vs. EIP-7702). EIP-4337, EIP-3074,
